The idea from David James:Goldlist method

The Goldlist method is a simple vocabulary learning method using your long-term memory. 
The author of this method is the famous polyglot, David James. 
The basic rule of this method is that every day you write down a list of 20 words/expressions you want to learn in your notebook (we call it a headlist).

The main idea of goldlist method using long-term memory, By using memory remained sediment to keep the memory.
For more step explanation, the memory was losting by the time passing, ebbinghaus give exact rule and data to represent all of thouse idea. By David james idea, using remaint of longtain product to take the memory and do it again and agagin.

From this idea, i have several idea and question about this method that may stongly important to me.
First, is time period for goldlist was 2 week or more perpose of. Can we faster the frequency to more stongth to remember?
seconds, When mention about memory, we all want some of knowledge was preserve for a hole life, from ebbinghuas expirment, if i want to take the memory for more than 80 ans i will time different to remmber that. So will remeber sequnce like this: 1min 20min 1h 6h 24h 2d 3d 7d 1m
